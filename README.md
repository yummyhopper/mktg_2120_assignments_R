# Marketing Data Science Assignments in R

This project is a compilation of assignments from Marketing 2120: Data Analytics for Marketing Decisions. These projects were completed in groups of four using pre-selected datasets across various topics testing various techniques. I've reorganized each assignment contains its own data, an annotated R notebook, and a write-up of the answers in a PDF. Here's a brief description of the individual assignments.


1. 
2.
3.
4. Computing CLV, Attribution Modelling, Conversion Probability

Data: The datasets used in these projects were provided by Wharton Customer Analytics, in conjunction with partner companies. These are real data sets provided for educational purposes. I am not able to put the datasets used in these assignments into this repository as that would be a breach of the Data User Agreement I've signed.
