# Marketing Data Science Assignments in R

This project is a compilation of assignments from Marketing 2120: Data Analytics for Marketing Decisions. These projects were completed in groups of four using pre-selected datasets across various topics testing various techniques. I've reorganized each assignment contains its own data, an annotated R notebook, and a write-up of the answers in a PDF. Here's a brief description of the individual assignments.


1. Hypothesis Testing, Net Promoter Score, Visualization
2. Multiple Regression, Logistic Regression, Predicting Churn
3. Designing and Analyzing Ratings Based Conjoint, Factor Analysis
4. Computing CLV, Attribution Modelling, Conversion Probability

Data: The datasets used in these projects were provided by Wharton Customer Analytics, in conjunction with partner companies. These are real data sets provided for educational purposes. I am not able to put the datasets used in these assignments into this repository as that would be a breach of the Data User Agreement I've signed.
